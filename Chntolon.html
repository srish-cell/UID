The picturesque streets wind their way around renowned attractions like Buckingham Palace, Westminster Abbey, and St. Paul's Cathedral, causing visitors to gape at their beauty and exhaust their phone's photo storage.

With so many impressive tourist attractions and captivating things to do, it's no wonder London is one of the most visited cities worldwide, receiving over 20 million tourists each year. Britain's bustling capital offers something for everyone, including shopaholics, foodies, adventurists, historians, and kids; but this can make it tough to choose what to do first.

Perhaps you'd prefer to take in a show, ride a horse through a grove, take a flight on the London Eye, or enjoy a traditional afternoon tea at Harrods.
